              <h3>Why Mornings?</h3>
              <p>“If you are to be successful... you will need to be inspired. You will need to receive revelation. I will give you one piece of advice: Go to bed early and get up early. If you do, your body and mind will become rested and then in the quiet of those early morning hours, you will receive more flashes of inspiration and insight than at any other time of the day.” (Harold B. Lee)</p>
              <p>“Cease to sleep longer than is needful; retire to thy bed early, that ye may not be weary; arise early, that your bodies and your minds may be invigorated” (D&C 88:124; emphasis added). Invigorate means “to fill with life and energy.”</p>
              <p>“To those who feel defeated and downtrodden, look to the early hours of the day for your rescue.” (Russell M. Nelson)</p>

                  <h4>Cognitive Dissonance</h4>
                  <p>“Cognitive dissonance means that our brains want to see our behaviors line up with what we believe is right or true or good. If our behaviors don't line up with our beliefs, then we are going to experience cognitive dissonance, and that is going to be uncomfortable.  So human nature is that we will either change our behaviors, or we will change our beliefs until the two align.” (Automated Blessings from God Podcast)</p>
                  <p>The elements of this morning routine helps us to spend more time strengthening our beliefs, and the more we reinforce those beliefs in our minds and hearts, the more our behaviors and our beliefs align.</p>

            </li>
            <li>Affirmations can help you to practice new thoughts over and over again and make new neuro pathways in your brain, so that you can then change your results.</li>
            <li>Affirmations can help remind you of who you REALLY are</li>
            <li>Patriarchal blessing affirmations (I took my Patriarchal blessing, and put the statements into affirmation format. i.e. “You are a daughter of God”, I would change to “I am a daughter of God.” “You have been blessed with choice qualities of mind and body” I would change to “I have been blessed with choice qualities of mind and body.” I then recorded myself saying these affirmations from my Patriarchal Blessing and then I try to listen to this recording during my morning routine (not always every morning, but as often as I want to). Listening to this, especially in my own voice, is really special. It helps me to see myself the way that God sees me. It helps me to see who I REALLY am deep inside (even if I don&#39;t always act in accordance with those qualities), and it also gives me so much excitement to see who I am going to be someday (as long as I do my part to strengthen those qualities within me). It is also a reminder of the things that I should be working on in my own personal life.</li>

            <li>We learn from the scriptures about the power of words and of thinking. “Sometimes all that is needed to change a life is a change in vocabulary. If the right words are used, perspective changes, and that is enough to create a small miracle.” “A great example of this was how the Prophet Joseph Smith could change things through the use of words, as described by William E. Berrett: “Characteristic of the Prophet, he renamed [the mosquito-infested swamp] to meet his desires. Not what it was, but what, with the faith and work of man, the region might become – &#39;Nauvoo, the City Beautiful.&#39;” “With just one word, people changed their thoughts about the land. It wasn&#39;t disgusting anymore; it was something beautiful that just hadn&#39;t reached its maturity. If you have been seeing your life as a swamp, yielding no fruit, then it is time to change your perspective. You can do this by changing the words you use to describe yourself and your life. The use of affirmations will help you make this change, and day after day, you will see the power of words more fully in your life.” (LDM)</li>
            <li>Sometimes we use affirmations just to change a thought from negative to positive (or at least to less negative or neutral)</li>
            <li>Sometimes we use affirmations to help with changing our weaknesses into strengths, in this case, be specific, write about how you will do that. For example “I will strengthen my faith... by reading my scriptures everyday.”</li>
            <li>
              <p>I used the following affirmation when I was working through my driving fears/anxiety. If you are interested, you can read the full story about this fear of mine here (http://lo-dawn.blogspot.com/2016/11/the- gift-of- dawn.html).</p>
              <p>Driving Affirmation:</p>
              <p>I am committed to becoming a courageous and confident driver by the end of 2015 so that I can take myself, my kids, and others where we need and want to go.</p>
              <p>To guarantee that I become a confident driver, I am committed to getting in the car and driving somewhere at least 3 times a week. I will keep moving forward even if it means taking baby steps. I will crawl, then walk, then run, then fly. Whatever I do, I will not allow myself to stop moving forward.</p>
              <p>
                What I want:
                <ul>
                  <li>be able to feel comfortable driving anywhere</li>
                  <li>be able to feel peaceful before/during driving</li>

                  <li>I want to be able to serve others</li>
                  <li>I want to take a load off of Jershon</li>
                  <li>I want to be able to feel confident and comfortable driving if there was an emergency</li>
                  <li>I want to conquer my fear and find more faith and testimony through that process</li>
                </ul>
              </p>
              <p>

                  <li>more peace</li>
                  <li>more trust in Heavenly Father</li>
                  <li>more experience with the atonement</li>

                </ul>
              </p>
              <p>
                How will I feel when it happens?
                <ul>
                  <li>accomplished</li>
                  <li>peaceful</li>

          <h3>Visualization</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>“Where there is no vision, the people perish.” (Proverbs 29:18)</li>
            <li>“Visualization is using your imagination, seeing in your mind&#39;s eye the things that you want most in your life... When you visualize, you give life to your goals, not just by giving them shape on paper like affirmations, but you are also able to clearly see your goals being accomplished and see the end result.” (LDM)</li>
            <li>Visualization is the process of imagining exactly what you want to achieve or attain, and then mentally rehearsing what you&#39;ll need to do to achieve or attain it. (TMM)</li>
            <li>Directly after reading your affirmations – where you took the time to articulate and focus on your goals and who you need to be to take your life to the next level – is the prime time to visualize yourself living in alignment with your affirmations. (TMM)</li>
            <li>The greatest gift we can give to the people we love is to live to our full potential. What does that look like for you? What do you really want? Forget about logic, limits, and being practical. If you could have anythin</li>g you wanted, do anything you wanted, and be anything you wanted – what would you have? What would you do? What would you be? (TMM)</li>
            <li>When you visualize daily, you align your thoughts and feelings with your vision. This makes it easier to maintain the motivation you need to continue taking the necessary actions. Visualization can be a powerful aid to overcoming self-limiting habits such as procrastination, and to taking the actions necessary to achieve your goals. (TMM)</li>
            <li>Think of a habit or reaction that you would like to change. Visualize the situation and how you would like to act and respond. Change the tone of your voice, change your expression, change your thinking – change it until you are satisfied. Play this new scene through in your mind a few times to practice. (LDM)</li>
            <li>Remember that nothing changes without action.</li>
            <li>When I was working through my driving fears, I would read my driving affirmation and then I would do a guided visualization (just found it online) and I would visualize myself driving and being confident and courageous.</li>

          <h3>Exercise</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>When you exercise for even a few minutes every morning, it significantly boosts your energy, enhances your health, improves self-confidence, and emotional well-being, and enables you to think better and concentrate longer. (TMM)</li>
            <li>Aim to become stronger and healthier than you were yesterday</li>
            <li>Anything is better than nothing</li>
            <li>Exercise (and eat well) because you love your body and want to take care of it and strengthen it, not because you hate it and just want it to change.</li>
            <li>This is the area that I need to work on the most, personally. I am not an expert when it comes to exercise. I tend to get stuck in the “I don&#39;t know what the perfect exercise routine is, so I&#39;m just paralyzed and don&#39;t do any (official exercise that is, I do move around through the day.)” I feel like there are so many options and opinions out there and I&#39;ve always felt like my ideal form of exercise (milder, slower paced, etc.) wasn&#39;t “good enough” so it doesn&#39;t count. But I&#39;ve been feeling recently that I shouldn&#39;t let this keep me from exercising. It doesn&#39;t have to be perfect. I don&#39;t have to sweat like crazy every time, or be worn out and exhausted by the end every time. Anything is better than nothing.</li>
            <li>Exercise is an important part of the morning routine, but don&#39;t feel like you have to fit all of your day&#39;s exercising into this routine. If you&#39;re like me, trying to fit 30+ minutes of exercise into the morning routine would just make you not want to exercise at all...because then you have hardly any time left to spend on the other elements of the routine. You can do some exercise during the morning routine, and then more later at a different time of day as well. Personally, I am striving to do 10-15 minutes during the routine and then more (going on a walk, riding my bike, doing a yoga video with my kids, etc.) at a different time of the day as well.</li>
